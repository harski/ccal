Introduction
============

Ccal is a calendar program with a curses user interface for terminal
emulators.  It uses readable plain text files for storing the entries.

Note that this project is in early developement stage, and things (for
example the save format) are going to be reworked and incompabilities
between versions will occur.


Compiling
=========

$ ./configure.sh
$ make

If you don't have the configure script, you need autotools to generate
it. When you have them installed, try running the autogen.sh script.


Installing
==========

Configure and compile ccal, and run

$ make install


Unistalling
===========

$ make uninstall
