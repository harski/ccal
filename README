Introduction
============

Ccal is a calendar program with a curses user interface for terminal
emulators.  It uses readable plain text files for storing the entries.

Note that this project is in early developement stage, and things (for
example the save format) are going to be reworked and incompabilities
between versions will occur.


Compiling
=========

Ccal needs two libraries: nucrsesw and vector. If you don't have
libvector, you can get it from https://github.com/harski/libvector. When
the dependencies are met you can configure and compile ccal with:

$ ./configure.sh
$ make


Installing
==========

Configure and compile ccal, and run

$ make install


Unistalling
===========

$ make uninstall
